# AgurkAPI

AgurkAPI is an API used to connect the functionality of different cooperative software, be it Trello, Discord, Google Calendar etc.
In this day and age we have a lot of different applications, and companies might not be using the same software. Thats why AgurkAPI came to life.
AgurkAPI seeks to help companies collaborating by allowing the companies to use the software they already know and love, without having to get a license for a new piece of software, to collaborate with another company.
